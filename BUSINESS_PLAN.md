# Business Plan: Local AI Platform

## Executive Summary

**Product:** Enterprise-grade, locally-deployable AI platform for privacy-sensitive and regulated industries.

**Unique Value:** Zero API costs + complete data privacy + domain customization + offline capability

**Target Markets:** Healthcare, Legal, Finance, Enterprise Documentation

**Revenue Potential:** $136K Year 1 → $680K Year 2 → $2.24M Year 3

---

## The Problem

### Current State:
- Companies want AI but can't use ChatGPT/Claude due to:
  - **Privacy concerns** (data leaks, vendor access)
  - **Regulatory requirements** (HIPAA, attorney-client privilege)
  - **Cost** ($20/user/month + per-query API fees = expensive at scale)
  - **Vendor lock-in** (can't customize, tied to external service)

### Pain Points:
1. **Healthcare:** Need AI but HIPAA requires local processing
2. **Legal:** Attorney-client privilege = can't use cloud AI
3. **Enterprise:** Internal docs are sensitive, can't share externally
4. **SMBs:** Want AI but can't afford enterprise prices

---

## The Solution

### Your Platform:
- **Local deployment** = Data never leaves customer servers
- **Zero API costs** = 50-80% cheaper than alternatives
- **Customizable** = Train on customer's specific domain/data
- **Offline capable** = Works without internet
- **Full ownership** = Customer owns the stack
